> **Note**: This template provides a structure for documenting the design of 
software built by the AI Engineering team at the Vector Institute. Not all sections 
may be relevant for your project - feel free to add, remove, or modify sections as needed. 
Architecture diagrams can be created using tools like [draw.io](https://app.diagrams.net/), 
[Mermaid](https://mermaid-js.github.io/mermaid/), or [Excalidraw](https://excalidraw.com/), 
then embedded or linked in this document.
